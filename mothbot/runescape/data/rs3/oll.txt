Earnt my Intern qualification with the Archaeology Guild.
Each time I rebuilt the statue of Dahmaroc in Varrock Museum, the archaeologists granted me a replica piece. It was a lot of work, but today I completed my own statue at home.
I levelled my  Archaeology skill, I am now level 5.
I have visited my Clan Citadel this week.
I levelled my  Divination skill, I am now level 64.
